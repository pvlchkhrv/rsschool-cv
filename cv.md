**About myself**
I believe that self-education, responibility, creativity and trust are the principles that made person today actualized. One of the most effective skills of the "modern kind" is the knowing how to learn. 

Let me mention my position at the moment. It is Deputy Head of The Intenational Cooperation Division of the Department for Industrial Safety (Gospromnadzor). In addition to my main functional responsibilities on the ground I`m in a position of the First Vice-Chair of the Working Group on Implementation of the UNECE TEIA Convention.

I`ve graduated from 2 universities during the last decade. All my life I was trying to stay out of the so-called "comfort zone" and trying to enrich my extiction with new challenges. Now I have interesting job and interesting connections with people from different countries.  What were the isssues that brought me into "today"? I think - constant learning, right perseption of fear and risk-managment. 

Today, I`ve found myself in the life period where I am so OK. I need a new challenge and give myself the opportunity to conquer another mountain.
