                <h3>About myself</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that self-education, responibility, creativity and trust are the principles that made
                    person actualized today. One of the most effective skills of the "modern kind" is the knowing how to
                    learn. Let me mention my position at the moment. It is Deputy Head of The Intenational Cooperation
                    Division of the Department for Industrial Safety (Gospromnadzor). In addition to my main functional
                    responsibilities on the ground I`m in a position of the First Vice-Chair of the Working Group on
                    Implementation of the UNECE Convention on Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents. I`ve
                    graduated from 2 universities during the last decade. All my life I was trying to stay out of the
                    so-called "comfort zone" and trying to enrich my extiction with new challenges. Now I have
                    interesting job and connections with interesting people from different countries. What were the
                    isssues that brought me into "today"? I think - constant learning, right perseption of fear and
                    risk-managment. Today, I`ve found myself in the life period where I am so OK. I need a new challenge
                    and give myself the opportunity to conquer another mountain.
